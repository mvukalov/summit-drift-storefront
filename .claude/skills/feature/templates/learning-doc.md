## 2. Osnovni pojmovi

<Table `| Pojam | Što znači |` with every term a beginner needs for this feature. Plain language, one line each.>

## 3. Problem koji rješavamo

<Why this feature exists. What goes wrong without it. Concrete examples from this project.>

## 4. Datoteke: što je dodano ili promijenjeno i zašto

<Every file from `git diff --stat main...HEAD`, grouped. One sentence of "why" per file. Generated files as one line.>

**Dodano**

| -------- | ----- |
| `<path>` | <why> |

**Izmijenjeno**

| Datoteka | Što se promijenilo i zašto |

**Obrisano** <only if any>

## 5. Kako radi: ključni dijelovi koda

<For each important part: a short intro, the snippet (not the whole file), and an explanation of the important lines below it. Order it the way data or control flows through the feature. Add a small text diagram if it helps.>

### 5.1 <Part name>

```<lang>
<snippet>
```

<Explanation: what it does, why it's written this way, what would break without it.>

## 6. Kako smo dokazali da radi

<8–12 questions. Each: the question in bold, then a short first-person answer as a quote, grounded in what this feature actually did.>
